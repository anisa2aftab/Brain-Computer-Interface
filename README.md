Human Brain:

                      Fig 1: Different regions of a human brain [1]

•	The human brain is the command center for the human nervous system

•	It receives input from the sensory organs and sends output to the muscles

•	It contains billions of nerve fibers (axons and dendrites)

•	These neurons are connected by trillions of connections, or synapses

Motivation:

•	In a paraplegic patient, the nerves connecting the lower parts of the body are damaged as 
   a result they are unable to move. And in the case of a tetraplegic patient, the spinal nerves   
   are damaged as a result they are unable to perform motor actions such as walking, lifting 
   objects, etc.
   
•	My motivation of work is to be part of a research which can improve the life of the needy 
   persons in the society
   
•	The aim of BCI lab of RRI is to develop a system to assist paraplegic or tetraplegic 
   patients to carry out different activities.
   
•	The ultimate noble aim of the lab is to provide low cost devices to physically 
   challenged persons.
   
•	This forms a bridge between my interest and the research of this lab.
